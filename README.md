![Demo](demo.png)

Welcome to the CSGO Trade-Up Scrapper! This is my epic final project for an extracurricular Python course offered by the mighty Google. 🎓 I embarked on this adventure during my second year of university, and now I present to you the ultimate tool for all CS:GO enthusiasts!

### 🌟 What is it all about?

Well, let me break it down for you. This badass program of mine updates a comprehensive list of every possible skin in the game CS:GO. 🎯 But it doesn't stop there! It takes it to the next level by scouring five specialized websites to fetch the latest selling prices of these awesome skins. 💸

### 🚀 The Quest for Infinite Profit!

Now, here comes the exciting part. The true purpose of this groundbreaking research is to find the magical combination of ten skins that can be used in a trade-up contract. 🎁 By utilizing this trade-up contract, we aim to score a higher-value skin that surpasses the total value of those ten individual skins! 💰 Can you smell the sweet scent of success?
